# 0.2.1
#   2:43pm until 6:00pm - 2-04-22 - a lot of progress wtf
#   2:13pm until 2:36pm - 4-04-22 - on a roadtrip uwu
# 0.2.3
#   3:22pm until 4:40pm - 9-04-22 - Gonna work on console interaction
#   a lot more time cause fml
# 0.2.4
#   4:48pm until 6:48pm - 13-04-22 - The fact that we're getting somewhere makes me cry of happiness.
#                                    So- A lot of the VERRYY basics have been done. We still needa work on:
#                                    - If/Else statements
#                                    - Try/Catch statements
#                                    - Loops
#                                    - Functions (Defining Them)
#                                    - Classes (Perfecting them however we're pretty much nearly done)
#                                    - More console interaction
#                               HOWEVER- In true- Nova fashion- I'm going to neglect all of them
#                                   Cause i've just found out there is a threading feature in python.
#
#                                   I will now add threading to StarScript bc it was totally wanted.
#   I've Moved a bunch of stuff from the main.py file to the new Changelog.json!

# Why The Recode?
#   The previous version was fairly good however the code was clunky and really hard to undersatnd after having any gap in development longer than a day.
#   Techniques used were really bad as well seeing as my knowledge of python was quite- screwed from when the project started to where it's at now.
#   Stuff like OtherData being a list and not a structure (For example)
#
#   This recode will have very easy-to-understand code and will utilise many of the new- amazing assistant features that have come out/i've been given access too
#   From the start of development to now.
#   SUCH AS~ The amazing Github Copilot system. literally so cool.
# 
#       With this i'll also be working on various different executers on the side- just to get this looking perfect.

#   #- Flags in classes (Done)
